# Home-Webserer-API

Using Flask as the backend web API hosted on a rasberry pi 4, I am taking data from a temperature sensor on an Arduino Uno R3 which send the data to the raspberry pi where it is stored in the webserver and an API to access the data from anywhere on my personal network, as well I have created simple buttons for toggling on and off an LED attached to the rasberry pi
